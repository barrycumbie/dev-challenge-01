    <p>Im majoring in IT with a concentration in HCI/UX. This is my last semester of my senior year and I'll graduate in the spring. <br /> I love working with java and I'm excited to get more into PHP this semester.</p>
    <p>
        I'm currently running all of my projects on new PC that my brother helped me build. I dont know much about the specs but I know its been a game changer for me. <br />
        I'm also typing on <a href="keyboardIMG.jpg" target="_blank"> my custom keyboard</a> that I worked on building all summer. <br />
        My favorite IDE to use is Visual Studio Code. Its super seamless for me and I love it. <br />
        Some common tools that I use are <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank"> Google Fonts</a>
        and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp" target="_blank"> W3Schools</a> for my color picker amongst many other things they offer.
        <br />
        I am really excited to get into PHP, scrum, and github. I think this class will help complete my resume. I'm also excited to learn about Agile and project managment.
    </p>
