# dev-challenge-01

Contribute to a Repo

Overview: In this challenge, you will interact with a PUBLIC GITHUB REPOSITORY (aka, the REPO) of which you neither an OWNER nor a COLLABORATOR.

The REPO: https://github.com/barrycumbie/dev-challenge-01

(well, technically the REPO has the .git extension: https://github.com/barrycumbie/dev-challenge-01.git)

What do we call this REPO?

The REMOTE, the MASTER (üëàüèº this term is deprecated circa 2020/2021) and is now: the MAIN (referring to the MAIN BRANCH of the REMOTE REPO)

Learning Time!

    "origin" is the local name of the remote repository.

FIRST THING TO KNOW for this challenge (well, first thing after all of that stuff up there ‚òùüèº): Never, just absolutely never, send a fellow DEV (me included) anything less than a link to your code.

(Remember what I said about Never?)

    +1 DEV CHALLENGE POINT: First one to find smart/smarter MEME (also known as EXPANDING BRAIN) about saving your code. Levels are like: copy/paste code into Word document, take a pic of your code, read your code aloud your code into voice recorder. I think there is one more but could just be the 3 levels. That is up to you to find.
