#dev-challenge-06

Assign yourself as a reviewer from a dev-created Issue/PR (i.e., not one from a dev challenge that everyone has to do) and complete a thorough code review. Is there (there should be) a discernible test and test site? Put your results in that comment card and all. 

Points = 1/2 that of the issue itself, rounded up (e.g. 10 point issue then the review is 5 points, 3 point issue card gets 2 points for review)

Submit from 0 to 3 of these.
