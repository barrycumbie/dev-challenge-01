# dev-challenge-01

### Contribute to a Repo

**Overview:**  In this challenge, you will interact with a PUBLIC GITHUB REPOSITORY (aka, the REPO) of which you neither an OWNER nor a COLLABORATOR. 

**The REPO:** https://github.com/barrycumbie/dev-challenge-01 

(well, technically the REPO has the .git extension: https://github.com/barrycumbie/dev-challenge-01.git) 

**What do we call this REPO?** 

The REMOTE, ~the MASTER~ (👈🏼 this term is deprecated circa 2020/2021) and is now: the MAIN (referring to the MAIN BRANCH of the REMOTE REPO) 

Learning Time! 
>"origin" is the local name of the remote repository.

**FIRST THING TO KNOW for this challenge** (well, first thing after all of that stuff up there ☝🏼): Never, just absolutely never, send a fellow DEV (me included) anything less than a link to your code. 

*(Remember what I said about Never?)*

> **+1 DEV CHALLENGE POINT:** First one to find smart/smarter MEME (also known as EXPANDING BRAIN) about saving your code. Levels are like: copy/paste code into Word document, take a pic of your code, read your code aloud your code into voice recorder. I think there is one more but could just be the 3 levels. That is up to you to find.
