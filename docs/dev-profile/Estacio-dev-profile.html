                    <h1 class='me'> About Me </h1>
                    <p>Here is a little bit about me, I am from Huntsville, Alabama. I went to Grissom High School where I also played football, we were famous for being the absolute worst team in the state with a record over 3 years of 1-29 so I guess you could say we were important in our own way. 
                        If you are wondering why I decided to not play football in college and instead pursue a CIS degree, that's because my senior year
                        of High School, I broke my left leg in two places and have a nice little metal plate in my leg for the rest of my life. Also I liked
                        computer stuff and took a couple of cyber security and coding courses in High School so I decided to pursue that further. Also I had
                        really no intention of playing college level football anyway, the leg thing was just insult to injury (literally).
                    </p>
                    <p>One thing I guess that is interesting to know about me is I like pro-wrestling a lot, and also completely understand that it is in fact not real fighting, because I don't grown men would fight eachother for the right to star in a shampoo commercial, 
                        or fight for the custody of a young child in a ladder match (yes these actually happened, I'm not creative enough to make this up). Also, I enjoy video games and real sports like Football (even played football and stopped after highschool because I shattered my leg, so thats fun), 
                        and I am proud to say that I am one of maybe 3 Los Angeles Chargers fans left in existence, we are a rare breed.</p>

                    <p>In my pass time, I like to play video games, watch sports or movies and shows. I play almost every type of game from RPG to strategy, to MMO and even FPS games.
                        My favorite game of all time is probably World of Warcraft because it was the first game I played religiously and I still play to this day. I also emulate games (shh dont tell Nintendo)like
                        old Gamecube, Wii, DS, GameBoy, N64, SNES, and NES games. I guess you could say I like video games a little bit, I also like sports. Like I said above I am a bid LA Chargers fan, and Oregon Ducks fan.
                        I really want to go to one of their games one of these days, and hopefully I can soon.</p>

                <h1 class="bonus">Bonus stuff about me</h1>
                <p> I have had multiple nicknames, when I played football from Middle School until my Senior year of High School people called me "Pistachio" because they thought my last name was pronounced "Ee-stah-she-oh" when it really isn't and is actually pronounced "Ee-stah-see-oh", also had a substitue teacher pronounce it like "Estakioko" which was more impressive than anything, I had no clue how he got that from "Andrew Estacio".</p>
                <p>My "dev environment" isn't much to talk about, and its just my laptop I bring to class, which a Lenovo gaming laptop, and it's specs aren't great anymore by todays standards, but its still works just fine. But as
                    of writing this and I'm working on the big final project, my graduation gift is my dad is helping me build a PC, and by some act
                    of some sort of divine intervention we managed to get a hold of an Nvidia Geforce RTX 3080 GPU. I have never felt more blessed in my life.</p>
                <p>By "skills" I assume coding languages I know and what IDE's I've used before and so on. Well, I've coded in Java, Python, and even SCRATCH (consider myself a little bit of a scratch master, no need to be jealous), I have also wrote in some marup langauges like HTML and know PHP, CSS, and Javascript, and even worked on databases in MySQL and MongoDB. I've only ever used Eclipse, Notepad++, NetBeans, VisualStudio and CodeAnywhere to code in.</p>

                    <li>Friniak: the simpsons search engine
                    <li>I remember at one point in the first day of class that you talked about how GitHub doesn't open a new tab when clinking on a link or anything else on the sight, and that it was annoying. And I have since also found it incredibly annoying.
                    <li>Vim is very hard to exit from apparently
                    <li>We talked about GitKraken and we talked about its ranking of best dev tools on their sight.
                    <li>You told us to make sure and always use keyboard shortcuts to do small things like copy and pasting, or refreshing the page
