        <h3>Short Description (Just rambling!)</h3>
        <p>
            My favorite food is fried rice, lol! And I can't eat chocolate......yes, seriously.<br>
            The first programming language I've ever learned was Java, something that pulled me into the world of coding.
            To me, programming is challenging but it's always fun. My goal in this semester is to build a couple of application
            with everything I've learned so far.
