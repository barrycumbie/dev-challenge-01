<h2> What it is... </h2>
<p>
Dynamic Systems Development technique, released 1994, is  agile development methoodology that approach that provides framework for building and maintaing systems. 
The method follows the 80% rule that enough work is needed for every increment to facilitate movement to the following increment.

<h3>DSDM Life Cycle</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b><i>Feasibility Study:</i></b></li>
	<p>
	It establishes the essential business necessities and constraints related to the applying to be designed then assesses whether or 
	not the application could be a viable candidate for the DSDM method.
	</p>
  <li><b><i>Business Study:</i></b></li>
		<p>
		It establishes the use and knowledge necessities that may permit the applying to supply business value; additionally, it is the essential application design 
		and identifies the maintainability necessities for the applying.
		</p>
  <li><b><i>Functional Model Iteration:</i></b></li>
  <p>
  It produces a collection of progressive prototypes that demonstrate practicality for the client.
  The intent throughout this unvarying cycle is to collect further necessities by eliciting feedback from users as they exercise the paradigm.
  </p>
  <li><b><i>Design and Build Iteration:</i></b></li>
  <p>
  It revisits prototypes designed throughout useful model iteration to make sure that everyone has been designed during a manner that may alter it to supply operational business price for finish users. 
  In some cases, useful model iteration and style and build iteration occur at the same time.
  </p>
  <li><b><i>Implementation:</i></b></li>
  <p>
  It places the newest code increment (an “operationalized” prototype) into the operational surroundings. 
  It ought to be noted that:
  <ul>
  <li>the increment might not 100% complete<i>
  <li> changes are also requested because the increment is placed into place. In either case, DSDM development work continues by returning to the useful model iteration activity.<i>
  </ul>
  <p/>
</ol>

<h4>Advantages of DSDM</h4>
<ul>
<li>Allows flexibility and on time delivery</li>
<li>Progress is easy to understand</li>
<li>Business cases are at the core of the DSDM model, ensuring delivered projects have real business value</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<h4>Disadvantages of DSDM</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can be too large and time consuming to mangae</li>
<li>Can be costly (i.e. not suitable for small organizations)</li>
<li>Can restrict and limit developer creativity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DSDM 8 Key Principles</h2>
<ol>
<li><em>Focus on the business need: <em/>DSDM teams must establish a valid business case and ensure organizational support throughout the project</li>
<li>Deliver on time: Work should be time-boxed and predictable, to build confidence in the development team.</li>
<li>Collaborate: DSDM teams must involve stakeholders throughout the project and empower all members of the team to make decisions.</li>
<li>Quality: To ensure high quality, the level of quality should be agreed with the business at the start of the project. This is enforced through continuous testing, review, and documentation.</li>
<li>Build incrementally from firm foundations: Teams must do enough design work up front (EDUF) to ensure they know exactly what to build, but not too much to slow development.</li>
<li>Developer Iteratively: Take feedback from the business and use this to continually improve with each development iteration. Teams must also recognize that details emerge as the project or product develops and they must respond to this.</li>
<li>Communicate continuously and clearly: Holding daily stand-up sessions, encouraging informal communication, running workshops and building prototypes are all key DSDM tools. Communicating through documents is discouraged - instead, documentation must be lean and timely.</li>
<li>Demonstrate control: The project manager and team leader should make their plans and progress visible to all and focus on successful delivery.</li>
