    <h1>Pull Request Advice</h1>
    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">First and foremost: what is a "Pull Request"?</h3>
    <p style="width: 35em; margin: auto">According to Github, "pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch."</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 3em"><strong>More Information about pull requests can be found <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests" target="_blank">here</a></strong></p>
    <h1>Tips For Ushering Pull Requests</h1>
    <div style="width: 30em; margin: auto; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 3em">
      <ul>
        <li>Always make sure your local repository/code is up-to-date with the main branch.</li>
        <li>Only add files that you edited or that are new and need staging for a push.</li>
        <li>Make sure your pull request is clear and concise.</li>
      </ul>

    <p style="width: 45em; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5em">Don't forget you can use HTML in your Pull Request! It can style up your repsonse, and make all the information clean. Also don't forget to be descriptive. Giving enough information, without giving too much, is the perfect way to inform your fellow developers what you are contributing to the project.</p>
