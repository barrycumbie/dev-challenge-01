	  <p>“Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. 
	  This Software is used for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other
	  fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies."</p>
	  <p>Scrum is one of the many project management agile methods. As so, it aims at boosting team productivity and velocity, 
	  optimizing product value by relying on regular feedbacks from final users. The name of this method, “Scrum”, was actually 
	  borrowed from the rugby world: just like rugby players, Scrum agile team members gather as many times as possible (in… scrums)
	  to check up on the project, always ready to change the initial plan. Therefore, Scrum is a pretty dynamic and always-moving approach that
	  encourages collaborative project management and guarantees the right balance for the client between the planned investment and the final delivered product.</p>
